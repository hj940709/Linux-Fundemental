Exercise 8
hostname>~LinuxFundementals2015/Week1/hostname.txt;cp ~LinuxFundementals2015/Week1/hostname.txt /cs/work/home/jxhou/;ssh ukko050.hpc.cs.helsinki.fi cat hostname.txt

Exercise 9
I create two empty subdir: Wednesday.2015.09.30.cp(CP for short) and  Wednesday.2015.09.30.rsync(RSYNC for short)

Use cp and rsync(with --stats argument) to copy files from /cs/home/tkt_cam/public_html/2015/09/30/ accordingly.
	cp --archive /cs/home/tkt_cam/public_html/2015/09/30 ~/LinuxFundamentals/Week1/Wednesday.2015.09.30.cp
	rsync --archive --stats /cs/home/tkt_cam/public_html/2015/09/30/ ~/LinuxFundamentals2015/Week1/Wednesday.2015.09.30.rsync
After execute rsync command, it reports following things:
	Number of files: 25 (reg: 24, dir: 1)
	Number of created files: 25 (reg: 24, dir: 1)
	Number of deleted files: 0
	Number of regular files transferred: 24
	Total file size: 9,886,229 bytes
	Total transferred file size: 9,886,229 bytes
	Literal data: 9,886,229 bytes
	Matched data: 0 bytes
	File list size: 0
	File list generation time: 0.003 seconds
	File list transfer time: 0.000 seconds
	Total bytes sent: 9,890,063
	Total bytes received: 475
If I re-execute rsync command on CP, it will report following things:
	Number of files: 25 (reg: 24, dir: 1)
	Number of created files: 0
	Number of deleted files: 0
	Number of regular files transferred: 0
	Total file size: 9,886,229 bytes
	Total transferred file size: 0 bytes
	Literal data: 0 bytes
	Matched data: 0 bytes
	File list size: 0
	File list generation time: 0.017 seconds
	File list transfer time: 0.000 seconds
	Total bytes sent: 479
	Total bytes received: 12
For the subdir RSYNC, it was empty before the execution of command. So rsync command copy all the files of picture.
For the subdir CP, it was populated with pictures. And rsync command compared pictures in it and decide which one to copy or to delete.
However, all the pictures in CP are identical to those in /cs/home/tkt_cam/public_html/2015/09/30/ so that no actual copy or delete will processed. That's also the reason why it will receive fewer bytes and be executed much more faster.


Exercise 10
date +%A.%Y.%m.%d
Tuesday.2016.11.01
bash script
	#!/bin/bash

	sdir="/cs/home/tkt_cam/public_html/`date +%Y`/`date +%m`/`date +%d`"
	tdir="~/LinuxFundamentals2015/Week1/`date +%A.%Y.%m.%d`"

	echo "rsync --archive --stats $sdir $tdir"
